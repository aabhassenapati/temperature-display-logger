The aim of this project is to measure and display thermoregulation in different plant species through real-time measurements of Plant Temperatures, Ambient Air Temperature, and Relative Humidity, which is also parrallely logged online and offline for research use of the data, and public exhbit of thermoregulation strategies in different plants.
This was developed as a project for the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona, supported by a community engagement grant from Harvey Mudd College.
